# Anemocheck
In this group project, myself along with Anand Jaiswar and Aman Jaiswal has made a social issue website on Anaemia. 
As we know that millions of people around the world suffer from this deadly disease. 
Hence it is necessary to aware more and more people about this deadly disease and therby reduce the numbers of people suffering from this disease.
We have made this website using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap.
Below is the link of our website. Do visit in Laptop or Tab. It doesn't supports on Android and IOS devices.
